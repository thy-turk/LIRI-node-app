## What is Liri?
Have you ever forgotten who wrote a song, or who that one actor is in a movie? Maybe you just want to see your favorite bands tour schedule. 
Liri aims to help with this. Liri is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. 
It is able to take in user input and provide information on movies, songs, bands and more!

## How to run the app: 
In order to run the app you'll need to clone the files in this repo to your machine. You'll also need your own spotify client ID and secret as mine is hidden.
You'll need to install the following npm packages: axios, moment, node-spotify-api and inquirer. These can be installed using the npm install command
in the terminal whilst in the root folder. Once setup is complete, run the file by typing ```node liri.js``` and inquirer will prompt you from there!
